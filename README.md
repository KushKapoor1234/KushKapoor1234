### 👋 About Me

I’m an engineering researcher working at the intersection of **signal processing**, **machine learning**, and **biological data analysis**. My work focuses on transforming complex physiological and sensor signals into interpretable, data-driven insights through modern deep learning and statistical modeling approaches.

### 🔬 Current Projects (As part of Teaching Assistance)

#### **Human Activity Recognition — Time-Series Deep Learning**

Developed a 1D-CNN time-series classification framework for the **UCI HAR dataset** using raw inertial sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope signals). The workflow integrates structured data preprocessing, stochastic augmentations (jitter, scaling, masking, mixup), and explainability analysis.
**Result:** Achieved 94.4% test accuracy (macro-F1 ≈ 0.94) with full reproducibility and artifact tracking.

#### **ECG Arrhythmia Classification — MIT-BIH Dataset**

Built a signal-processing pipeline and deep learning model for ECG-based arrhythmia detection. The pipeline includes denoising, beat segmentation, class balancing, and CNN-based feature learning, along with extended time‑frequency analysis (Lomb–Scargle, CWT scalograms, coherence) with attention to interpretability and medical relevance. 
**Result:** High per-class precision and robust performance across arrhythmia types on benchmark data.
